  {
    question: "What is Bitcoin QS?",
    answer: "Bitcoin QS is a quantum-safe Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin, designed to protect assets against future quantum computing threats while maintaining compatibility with the existing Bitcoin network."
  },
  {
    question: "How does Bitcoin QS work?",
    answer: "Bitcoin QS implements post-quantum cryptographic algorithms on a Layer 2 network that runs parallel to Bitcoin's main chain, providing quantum-resistant security while preserving Bitcoin's core features."
  },
  {
    question: "Is Bitcoin QS compatible with regular Bitcoin?",
    answer: "Yes, Bitcoin QS is fully compatible with the Bitcoin network. You can easily bridge your BTC to quantum-safe BQS tokens and back using our secure bridge protocol."
  }
];

export const technicalFAQs = [
  {
    question: "What cryptographic algorithms does Bitcoin QS use?",
    answer: "Bitcoin QS uses NIST-approved lattice-based cryptography, specifically designed to resist attacks from both classical and quantum computers."
  },
  {
    question: "How does the bridge process work?",
    answer: "The bridge process involves locking your BTC in a secure multi-signature contract and minting an equivalent amount of BQS tokens. These tokens can be converted back to BTC at any time through the same bridge."
  },
  {
    question: "What are the transaction fees?",
    answer: "Transaction fees on the Bitcoin QS network are typically lower than Bitcoin's main chain, as our Layer 2 solution enables more efficient processing while maintaining security."
  }

export const walletFAQs = [
  {
    question: "How do I store my BQS tokens?",
    answer: "You can store BQS tokens in any Bitcoin QS-compatible wallet. We recommend using our official desktop or mobile wallets for the best security and features."
  },
  {
    question: "Are my assets safe against quantum attacks?",
    answer: "Yes, all transactions and storage on the Bitcoin QS network are protected by quantum-resistant cryptography, ensuring your assets remain secure even against future quantum computers."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if I lose my wallet?",
    answer: "Like any cryptocurrency wallet, it's crucial to backup your recovery phrase. If you lose access to your wallet, you can restore it using your recovery phrase on any Bitcoin QS-compatible wallet."
